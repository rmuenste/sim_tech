    \begin{itemize}
      \item Design your desired postprocessing plot in i.e. Jupyter notebook
      \item Save your python code to a script, eventually add file handling/manipulation code			
      \item Add code to save your plot to a file				
      \item Transfer the script to the compute cluster						
      \item Execute script on the cluster, transfer the resulting file to local computer									
    \end{itemize}
